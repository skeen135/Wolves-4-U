 <h2>HUNTING!</h2>
<p>Wolves are amazing animals that are widley hunted for their fur as decoration. They are inocent creatures that do not deserve to be hunted by these cruel poeple.We must try to prevent these beautiful, freandly, harmless mamles from becoming extinct.</p>
<h3>A Wolves Diet</h3>
<p>Wolves diets are very interesting as it only contains meat. This isnt the eavenly sliced meat you get from the shop. It is meat that come strait off the bone this includes:Rabits, sheep, cows and deer. There are a variety of animals that wolves hunt to keep themselves and their cubs alive. Eventhough their diet sounds really groosom they are very clever and intelagent due to how they hunt. They are able to sneek up on the prey and pounce at the right moment and catch them for their dinner.</p>
<h4>Wolf Cubs</h4>
<p>Wolves are increadibal creatures that can have up to 3 to 5 cubs every litter. This means that if a whole pack of wolves had a litter of 5 than there would be arround 60 in total but other wolves in the pack can kill the young due to them feeling left out.</p>
<h5>Habitats</h5>
<p>Wolves have a variaty of different habitats but they are most offen found in woods to keep themselves and their cubs safe from predators. They can also find more food their as most of their prey are nocternal esspesally rabits and deer, this is helpful as it allows them to survive. Groups of trees and bushes are perfect for a wolf habitat as it can help to keep them warm in the winter and the mountaines are perfect to keep them cooler in the summer but It is very unlikely that you would see a wolf at st cathrins hill or any other place like that as it is a place where lots of poeple go.</p>
